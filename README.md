The project is reorganized by Cell Pattern.
        The Cell Pattern is meanings that every importent GameObject is a cell. 1.Cell communicating with another cell by Communicate Script and Direct Communicate Script.
2.A cell have all of it's State Scripts and Controller Scripts.
I designed Manage Cell,Player Cell,Input Cell,Enemy Cell,Menu Cell to create    the game.
